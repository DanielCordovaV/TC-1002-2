# K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN)
K in KNN is the number of nearest neighbors considered for assigning a label to the current point.
K is an extremely important parameter and choosing the value of K is the most critical problem when working with the KNN algorithm.  
## What is it?
K-Nearest Neighbors is a:
- **Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm** 
- **No parametric**, no assumption about the distribution of data.
- **Lazy Learning Algorithm**, It does not have a training phase but rather memorizes the training data set. 
- **Local**, it assumes that the class of a data depends only on the k closest neighbors. 
- **Simple**
